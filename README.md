# PINT

Template for Node.js SPAs using Express and Yeoman(or something else with folder structure like in Yeoman)

## Getting Started

1. Download [archive](https://github.com/avovsya/pint/archive/master.zip) and unzip
2. Run *npm install* command
3. Initialize Yeoman in public/ directory
4. Put you routes in app.coffee(or anywhere else, but don't forget to require in app.coffee)
5. Put you server-side tests written using Mocha in test/ directory
6. Put you client-side tests(also Mocha) in public/test/spec/coffee
7. Run *grunt* command and voil√† - you've got server with autoreload server-side and client-side(livereload) scripts 

## Prerequisites

### Global packages, that should be installed:
+ grunt-cli
+ nodemon
+ coffee-script
+ node-inspector
+ nodev (for easily debugging with node-inspector)

## What's include

### Grunt tasks
+ server - will watch your server-side code and restart server on changes. Also watches you client side html,css,js(coffee) and LiveReloads it. Go to localhost:6001 and check it out.
+ debug - run node server in debug mode and also run node-inspector
+ test - run your server-side tests

## Notes

### Coffee-script 
You can write your client-side code(and tests) in coffee-script.
Put scripts in public/app/coffee and public/test/spec/coffee and they will
be automatically compiled to public/app/scripts and public/test/spec
respectively. Folder structure will be saved. 

### Testing
To execute your server-side tests run *grunt test* command. 
Unfortunately *grunt-mocha* plugin which is used to run client-side test without
browser(using PhantomJS) have unpredictable behavior(wrong test can pass, and this depends
in order in which tests been executed). You can open localhost:6001/test(only in development
and test environments) to run Mocha tests in browser. Tests is also support livereloading.

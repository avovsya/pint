 + client-side test on coffee-script
 + grunt task to build coffee-script
 - use execSync(https://github.com/mgutz/execSync) to run coffee compiler(coffee and coffee-tests commands)
 - make client side coffe-script path like in Yeoman
 - move express config to separate file
 - test-watch
 - create Demo application

 Future features:
 - building and deploy app locally(cluster, nginx)
 - support for less(???)
 - linting coffee scripts - https://github.com/vojtajina/grunt-coffeelint
 
 Bugs:
 - grunt-mocha - unpredictable behavior. Wrong assertions can pass
 - grunt-reload - Version for grunt 0.4 sometimes turns off

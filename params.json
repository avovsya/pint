{"name":"Pint","tagline":"Template for Yeoman with Express.js backend.","body":"# PINT\r\n\r\nTemplate for single page applications using Express and Yeoman(or something else with folder structure like in Yeoman)\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n1. Download [archive](https://github.com/avovsya/pint/archive/master.zip) and unzip\r\n2. Run `npm install` command\r\n3. Initialize Yeoman in public/ directory\r\n4. Put you routes in app.coffee(or anywhere else, but don't forget to require in app.coffee)\r\n5. Put you server-side tests written using Mocha in test/ directory\r\n6. Put you client-side tests(also Mocha) in public/test/spec/coffee\r\n7. Run `grunt` command and voil√† - you've got server with autoreload server-side and client-side(livereload) scripts \r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### Global packages, that should be installed:\r\n+ grunt-cli\r\n+ nodemon\r\n+ coffee-script\r\n+ node-inspector\r\n+ nodev (for easily debugging with node-inspector)\r\n\r\n## What's include\r\n\r\n### Grunt tasks\r\n+ server - will watch your server-side code and restart server on changes. Also watches you client side html,css,js(coffee) and LiveReloads it. Go to localhost:6001 and check it out.\r\n+ debug - run node server in debug mode and also run node-inspector\r\n+ test - run your server-side tests\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n### Coffee-script \r\nYou can write your client-side code(and tests) in coffee-script.\r\nPut scripts in public/app/coffee and public/test/spec/coffee and they will\r\nbe automatically compiled to public/app/scripts and public/test/spec\r\nrespectively. Folder structure will be saved. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTo execute your server-side tests run `grunt test` command. \r\nUnfortunately **grunt-mocha** plugin which is used to run client-side test without\r\nbrowser(using PhantomJS) have unpredictable behavior(wrong test can pass, and this depends\r\nin order in which tests been executed). You can open localhost:6001/test(only in development\r\nand test environments) to run Mocha tests in browser. Tests is also support livereloading.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Artem Vovsya  \r\nLicensed under the MIT license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
